## Cantrips

### Detect Magic

**Keywords**: cantrip, concentrate, detection, manipulate

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 323](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1485)

**Traditions** arcane, divine, occult, primal

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Area**: 30-foot emanation

You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you're fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.

You detect illusion magic only if that magic's effect has a lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

**Heightened (3rd)** You learn the rank or level of the most powerful magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.

**Heightened (4th)** As 3rd rank, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-rank magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

### Divine Lance

**Keywords**: attack, cantrip, concentrate, manipulate, sanctified, spirit

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 325](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1498)

**Traditions**: divine

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Range**: 60 feet; **Targets**: 1 creature

**Defence**: AC

You unleash a beam of divine energy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target's AC. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 spirit damage (double damage on a critical hit).

**Heightened (+1)**: The damage increases by 1d4.

### Guidance

**Keywords**: cantrip, concentrate

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 334](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1549)

**Traditions**: divine, occult, primal

**Cast**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet; **Targets**: 1 creature

**Duration**: until the start of your next turn

You ask for the guidance of supernatural entities, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

### Light

**Keywords**: cantrip, concentrate, light, manipulate

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 340](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1585)

**Traditions**: arcane, divine, occult, primal

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Range**: 120 feet

**Duration**: until your next daily preparations

You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement.

You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four light spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

**Heightened (4th)**: The orb sheds light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).

### Needle Darts

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Range**: 60 feet; **Targets** 1 creature

**Defense**: AC

You shape three needles out of a piece of metal in your possession and send them flying in a tight group toward one target. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. The needles deal 3d4 piercing damage and might cause bleeding. The needles impart any special properties of the metal that forms them; for instance, cold iron needles deal additional damage to creatures with weakness to cold iron. All the needles are made of the same metal, and the metal returns to you after the attack.

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage and 1 persistent bleed damage.
Success The target takes full damage.

**Heightened (+1)**: You send one additional needle, increasing the regular damage by 1d4 and increasing the persistent bleed damage on a critical hit by 1.

You cause a splash of cold water to descend on an ally's head, granting some temporary vigor. The target gains 1d4 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute. The target is then temporarily immune to the temporary Hit Points from rousing splash for 10 minutes. The target can also attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

**Range**: touch; **Targets**: 1 lock, or a door or container with a latch

**Duration**: until your next daily preparations

The target's latch mechanism clinks shut, held fast by unseen magical wards. When you magically lock a target, you set an Athletics and Thievery DC to open it equal to your spell DC or the base lock DC with a +4 status bonus, whichever is higher. Any key or combination that once opened a lock affected by this spell does not do so for the duration of the spell, though the key or combination does grant a +4 circumstance bonus to checks to open the door.

If the target is opened, the spell ends. Assuming the target is not barred or locked in some additional way, you can unlock and open it with an Interact action during which you touch the target. This does not end the spell. You can Dismiss this spell at any time and from any distance.

The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area.

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Range**: 30 feet; **Targets**: 1 creature

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You forge a temporary link between the target's life essence and your own. The target takes half damage from all effects that deal Hit Point damage, and you take the remainder of the damage. When you take damage through this link, you don't apply any resistances, weaknesses, or other abilities you have to that damage; you simply take that amount of damage.

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Range**: touch; **Targets**: 1 willing creature

**Duration**: 1 minute

The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing it using hearing alone. The target can't use sonic attacks, nor can it use auditory actions. This also prevents the target from casting spells due to the magical words involved in casting, with the exception of subtle spells.

**Heightened (4th)**: The spell creates an aura in a 10-foot emanation around the touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through it. While within the aura, creatures are subject to the same effects as the target.

**Cast**: 2 actions

**Range**: 120 feet; **Targets**: 1 target

**Defense**: AC; **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You create a ghostly, magical echo of one weapon you're wielding or wearing and fling it. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, dealing 2d8 damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). The damage type is the same as the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon). The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). This attack uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. After the attack, the weapon returns to your side. If you sanctify the spell, the attacks are sanctified as well.

Each time you Sustain the spell, you can repeat the attack against any creature within 120 feet.

**Heightened (+2)**: The damage increases by 1d8.
