## Party Loot

- Empty

## Lumber Mill Notes

- Dead body desecrated, has a 7-pointed star carved into him.  Exact match to the seven pointed star.
- Scratches made by a creature with claws.
- Smell near the wounds made by the claws smell even worse than normal.
- Horrific decomposition.
- Ibor Thorn only survivor, discovered bodies.  Questioned by sheriff, held by guards for protection.
- Ven Vendor is a suspect, owner of general store.  Trean was his daughter.  When informed, flew into a rage.  Fought like hell regardless.  Behavior makes sense, but is weird with respect to actions.
- Other murders: conment from Galduria, murdered in abandoned bar, bodyguards survived now in insane asylum.
