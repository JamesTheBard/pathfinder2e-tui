## Feats

### Shield Block (Heritage 1)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 262](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5212)

**Action** Reaction

**Trigger** While you have your shield raised, you would take physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) from an attack.
You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.

**Keywords** General

### Natural Ambition (Ancestry 1)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 64](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4478)

You were raised to be ambitious and always reach for the stars, leading you to progress quickly in your chosen field. You gain a 1st-level class feat for your class. You must meet the prerequisites, but you can select the feat later in the character creation process in order to determine which prerequisites you meet.

**Keywords** Human

### Healing Hands (Cleric 1)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 114](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4646)

**Prerequisites** healing font

Your vitality is even more vibrant and restorative. When you cast heal, you roll d10s instead of d8s.

**Keywords** Cleric

### Courtly Graces (Background 1)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 254](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5138)

**Prerequisites** trained in _Society_

You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics. Unless you are intentionally presenting yourself differently, anyone who speaks with you will assume you are a noble or closely associated with the nobility (such as a prominent servant). You can use Society to Make an Impression on a noble, as well as with Impersonate to pretend to be a type of noble or a specific individual noble. If you use the normal skills in those situations, you receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the check instead.

**Keywords** General, Skill

### Communal Healing (Cleric 2)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 115](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4648)

You’re an exceptional conduit for vitality and, as you channel it through you, you can divert some to heal yourself or another creature. When you cast the heal spell to heal a single creature, choose another willing living creature within range of your heal to regain Hit Points equal to the heal spell’s rank.

**Keywords** Cleric, Healing, Vitality

### Bastion Dedication (Archetype 2)

**Source**: [Advanced Player's Guide, p. 159](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1895)

**Prerequisites** _Shield Block_ feat

You are particularly skilled at using a shield in combat. You gain the _Reactive Shield_ fighter feat. This fulfills any prerequisite requiring Reactive Shield as normal.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bastion archetype.

**Keywords** Archetype, Dedication

### Reactive Shield (Feat 1)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 120](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4772)

**Trigger** An enemy hits you with a melee Strike

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield

You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the Raise a Shield action and gain your shield’s bonus to AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you’re determining the outcome of the triggering attack.

**Keywords** Fighter

### Intimidating Glare (Skill 2)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 257](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5162)

**Prerequisites** trained in _Intimidation_

You can Demoralize with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don’t take a penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language.

**Keywords** General, Skill

### Emblazon Armament (General 3)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 115](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4649)

Carefully etching a sacred image into a physical object, you steel yourself for battle. You can spend 10 minutes emblazoning a symbol of your deity upon a weapon or shield. The symbol doesn’t fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol you previously emblazoned, and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The emblazoned item is a religious symbol of your deity in addition to its normal purpose, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. The benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents, but others can use the item normally.

- **Shield** The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce more damage with the Shield Block reaction.).
- **Weapon** The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls with the weapon.

**Keywords** Cleric, Exploration

### Raise Symbol (Cleric 4)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 116](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4658)

**Requirements** You are wielding a religious symbol.

You present your religious symbol emphatically. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws until the start of your next turn. While it’s raised, if you roll a success at a saving throw against a vitality or void effect, you get a critical success instead.

If the religious symbol you’re raising is a shield, such as with Emblazon Armaments, you gain the effects of Raise a Shield when you use this action and the effects of this action when you Raise a Shield.

**Keywords** Cleric

### Disarming Block (Archetype 4)

**Source**: [Advanced Player's Guide, p. 159](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1896)

**Action** free action

**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication; trained in _Athletics_

**Trigger** You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a held weapon.

You attempt to Disarm the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.

**Keywords** Archetype

### Battle Medicine (Skill 4)

**Source**: [Player Core, p. 253](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5125)

**Prerequisites** trained in _Medicine_

**Requirements** You're holding or wearing a healer's toolkit.

You can patch up wounds, even in combat. Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for Treat Wounds and restore the corresponding amount of HP; this doesn’t remove the wounded condition. As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.
