# Pathfinder 2E Terminal Character Sheet

It's a basic Pathfinder 2nd Edition character sheet written as a terminal application.  Everything you'd want, but none of those fancy things like graphics or pixels.

## Installation

### Requirements

- `python` installed.  It was written using `3.12`, but I'm pretty sure it will run under older versions without issue.
- `poetry` installed (https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
- `git` installed.

### Procedure

1. Clone the repo using `git`.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/JamesTheBard/pathfinder2e-tui.git
```

2. Install all of the libraries.

```console
$ cd pathfinder2e-tui
$ poetry init
```

3. Run the ill-named `hello_world.py` file.

```console
$ poetry run python hello_world.py
```

4. Enjoy!
